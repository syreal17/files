<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are going to have real fun here. And, you will gain the ability to do impressive things in life using a computer. It will be like acquiring a superpower to be able to do things that ordinary people cannot do. Let’s see how that is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common mobile device, the one you might have in your hands right now, can have 100,000 times more computing power than the computer used to send humans to the moon for the first time. There are 7.7 billion humans; did you know that by 2020 there will be more than 30 billion devices connected to the Internet? Imagine all that power&#8230;&#8203; you could do many unprecedented things with only a little part of it, and that power keeps growing everyday&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our world depends on computers. Imagine the apocalyptic catastrophe if computers ceased to work: money in banks is inaccessible, all telecommunications die, airports cease functioning and commercial airliners would  fall from the sky, energy distribution systems become uncontrollable, hospitals and critical life support systems would irrevocably fail, and our society would collapse. In 1988, a single person, without bad intentions, took down all the Internet with just one malicious program, known as the Morris Worm. Society was different at that time so it was not as catastrophic as it would have been now. But, why we have not collapsed yet?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only way to overcome a weakness is to first know that it exists. Hackers find weaknesses in the computer world. The word hacker has had several definitions throughout history. In a dictionary, we can find two related definitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>An expert at programming and solving problems with a computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in a computer system</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are going to take a little from both definitions, but we will gain access and tamper with information for good. In other words, a skill can be used for malicious purposes or, to become the real-life hero that manipulates technology at will, keeping the planes in the sky, and society out of collapse. That sounds romantic, but you will realize that just the mere fact of making your computer make something awesome, and getting a secret flag generates emotions and adrenaline. Come with us on this journey to become a real hacker!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_shell">2. The Shell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div id="shl" class="paragraph">
<p>The Shell is foundational to so many parts of securing computing devices and
their networks. Intimidating and alluring (like most symbols enshrined by film
makers), understanding the shell can make or break one&#8217;s ability to solve
challenges in a capture-the-flag competition like picoCTF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be transparent, I (LT) am still learning a lot about the shell, and I&#8217;m
just about 10 years into it right now! This is an encouragement - anyone
curious enough to jump into rabbit holes here and there is always going to have
opportunities to learn more about an amazing tool like the shell. But rest
assured, I was proficient in the shell long ago and it does not take very much
time before the shell starts working for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next up, what is that mystique unique to the hacker and their shell?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_symbol_of_the_hacker">2.1. Symbol of the Hacker</h3>
<div id="shl-symbol-of-the-hacker" class="paragraph">
<p>A blank, black screen and blinking cursor. Lines and lines of scrolling text
and someone in front of that screen who seemingly understands an
incomprehensible flow of information. That is the shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shell has many other names: the terminal, the command prompt, bash&#8230;&#8203;
PowerShell, if you&#8217;re looking at Windows and feeling blue. Each name has its
own nuances. But that doesn&#8217;t matter right now. What matters is that there is
the interface to computing devices that nearly all people use, and then there
is the shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve come here to get a shell and don&#8217;t care for much else, then you
should skip to the <a href="#shl-get-a-shell">Get a Shell</a> section. Be warned that the
shell is more powerful than the usual way of interacting with a device.
Deleting files is permanent in the shell, any file can be accessed at any
moment in the shell, and hopefully it&#8217;s not farfetched to assert that those
two things are a dangerous combination.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_got_shell">2.2. Got Shell?</h3>
<div id="shl-got-shell" class="paragraph">
<p>Using a computer or smart device happens in 1 of 2 ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Using a pointer such as a mouse, touchpad or finger to select apps, files,
or buttons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using keys on a keyboard to enter simple or complex commands (the Shell)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thankfully, there are TLA&#8217;s (Three Letter Acronyms) for both methods
described above:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>GUI. Pronounced "gooey," stands for Graphical User Interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CLI. Sounded out: "See-El-Eye," stands for Command Line Interface</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These acronyms are pretty good as far as acronyms go. We will refer to the
shell by many names, perhaps sometimes even by the CLI initialism. The GUI
doesn&#8217;t have as nice of a name as the shell, so we will probably use GUI to
briefly refer to the interface that everyone knows about on computing devices
that is driven by a pointer on a screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is a screenshot of a shell after successful login and before the user has
typed in any commands:</p>
</div>
<div id="first-look" class="imageblock text-center">

<div class="title">Figure 1. The shell waiting for a command</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the picture above, there is a lot of empty space, and even the line of text
that exists, does not provide a lot of clarity. The situation is simpler than
how it looks. There are only 3 pieces of information in the screenshot above,
and you would likely recognize at least one of them if it were <strong>you</strong> who logged
on:</p>

For this reason, I advise you to create a picoCTF 2019 account at this point if
you have not already. Beyond providing 120+ security challenges in helpful

<p>A note on the structure of my (LT&#8217;s) chapters: many times I will provide a high
level tutorial for a task and also a step by step walkthrough for the same
task.  This is my attempt at accommodating different learning styles and,
different levels of experience. Typically, the high-level walkthrough is more
for learners who already know the basics but need a refresher or need a
reminder about the particulars when it comes to this Primer. The step by step
walkthrough is more for learners who have never ventured in a particular task
before. Of course, you must choose your own path here, but the safest bet may
be to read the high-level walkthrough but actually put hands to keyboard for
the step by step walkthrough.</p>

<p>Our first language as children, whether Spanish, English or anything else
primarily for communication with other humans, likely took little conscious
effort on our part. For anyone who has learned a second language, it was quite
the opposite: very little - if anything - came naturally. Learning Shell for
someone who has only "spoken" GUI is like learning a second language. This is
good news and bad news. The good news is that Shell and GUI are languages for
something you&#8217;ve been using for probably years, but the bad news is there is a
whole new vocabulary with only a handful of cognates (words that sound and mean
the same in both languages) here and there.</p>

<p>As the table above shows, using a GUI involves browsing and clicking, while
using a shell involves knowing a good app to use. Google has made finding the
right app for a shell interface much easier than it was years ago. As always
for CTF&#8217;s, Google is your friend! However, more direct resources can be even
more helpful, such as this website below that quickly explains shell commands:</p>

<div id="shl-what-the-shell" class="paragraph">
<p>The main severity in the learning curve with the shell is that you must know
the apps and commands available to you either by memorization or by looking
them up when you need them. Certainly, it is faster to memorize as many as
possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other challenge is the amount of typing that sometimes must be done to
reference the intended file.</p>

<p>Lastly, interfacing with apps also requires memorizing or looking up names of
parameters or arguments.</p>

<h4 id="_challenge_2_typing_out_long_commands">2.5.2. Challenge 2: Typing out long commands</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many wonderfully brilliant students of mine have not known how to speed up
their typing in the shell command prompt until thousands of picoCTF points into
their learning. I take responsibility for this, and really, most of us go
through that phase, but we do not have to! One word:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TAB</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the shell, pressing the TAB key invokes auto-complete by 1. assuming you&#8217;ve
spelled the command or file correctly up to the point of pressing tab, and 2.
completing the command of file name as much as it can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The functionality of auto-complete in the shell is so different from
auto-complete in other apps, such as those in a phone, that shell auto-complete
is often referred to as tab-complete. It takes some practice to get used to,
but it is worth the time as it probably cuts number of key presses in half!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike auto-complete for a soft keyboard on a phone, tab-complete is never
wrong, however, this is mostly because it makes no guesses and only helps with
completing commands and file paths and names. It hardly ever helps complete
arguments to commands besides file names. If pressing tab doesn&#8217;t do anything,
this is either because 1. there is no such command or file name to complete
what you&#8217;ve already typed into the command prompt, or 2. there are multiple
commands or file names that could complete what you&#8217;ve already typed into the
command prompt. Try typing another letter or two. Hit the tab key again. If
nothing more is completed, hit tab one more time. If nothing really happens
besides an angry noise or flash, then there is no way to complete what you&#8217;ve
already typed (maybe there is a typo?), but if the issue is that there are
multiple possibilities for tab complete to choose, then these options will
display after your second strike on the tab key. The double press of tab can
be done at any time, but if there are hundreds of options then the shell will
ask for your approval before printing all those options because that&#8217;s not
usually very helpful.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let the Shell lessons sink in as you learn more about one of the most popular
and powerful programming languages to grace the Earth.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_programming_in_python">3. Programming in python</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computer program is a set of instructions that allow us to do a task automatically on a computer. We can make a computer program in a programming language. Computer programs are generally called "software". With a computer program we can do all sorts of things. Some examples are calculators, video games, text processors, browsers, and all the things you have ever used in a computer. Nowadays, there are computers everywhere. Any device such as a cell phone, smart watch, or modern car is running software that was made in programming. To begin, we are going to learn python, which is one of the easiest programming languages to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s begin writing python! We are not going to explain each detail of python independently. For that, you could read the python documentation, which is located here:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html, window="_blank"</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if you don’t know any programming, going directly to the documentation can be overwhelming. We are just going to explain some parts of python which are a good start to begin to write your own programs to exploit software. We do this by making examples that achieve one objective and we explain how they work along the way. This will allow you to read code written by someone else, of course, with the help of google if they use elements that you did not know previously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are learning a programming language, there is a tradition in which the first program you write simply prints "Hello World!"" on the screen. We will be using python 2, the number 2 is the version of python. There are already higher versions, however, we are using python 2 because it is compatible with the exploitation libraries we will teach. Nonetheless, after you learn python 2, it is very easy to learn python 3. Let’s start doing the "hello world!" program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the shell server, and create a folder called "python_examples". You can do it with the following line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">mkdir python_examples</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, access that folder using</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">cd python_examples</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create a file called "helloworld.py", you can do it with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">nano helloworld.py</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make our 'hello world!' program in python requires just one line of code! Simply write this on the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">print "Hello World!"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now save the file in nano by pressing 'control' and 'x' at the same time, and then press 'y', then 'enter'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run the program on the terminal with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">python helloworld.py</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see that is printed "Hello World!"" on the screen when you run it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">python helloworld.py
Hello World!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was our first program in python!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Python, as any other programming language, has variables. A variable can hold different types of data. What we just printed on the screen, was a string of characters. When we enclose something in quotes, we are telling python it is a string of characters. A string is a data type. In python, to create a variable we simply choose a name and assign the value that we want. For example, we are going to create a variable called my_string, and we are going to assign to that variable the value "Hello World!"</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">my_string = "Hello World!"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That line of code makes the variable my_string equals to "Hello World!". In python programming, the symbol = is used to assign the value from the right side of the equal to the variable at the left side. Variables can have any name we like, except some specific words that are reserved for python instructions. For example, the word 'print' is reserved, so you cannot use it as a variable name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if we print the variable, it should print "Hello World!". Do that experiment next. The python script should look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">my_string="Hello World!"
print my_string</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run it and you will see "Hello World!"" printed on the screen again.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">Hello World!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also assign numbers to variables and do mathematical operations between them. Let’s make a simple program that calculates the area of a square. Create a file called "area.py" and write the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">side1=4
side2=8
result=side1*side2
print result</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run that script, what do you think is going to print?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run it you should see:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">32</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those were very trivial examples. Now, suppose you want to print a list of 20 numbers that starts at 0 and ends at 19. We can do that in just a couple of lines, instead of writing 20 prints! Create a file called loop.py and use the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(20):
    print i</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run it and you should see:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have introduced the concept of a python loop. The word 'for' is used to declare a 'for loop', which is a loop that iterates in a range of numbers. The 'i' next to 'for', is a variable that will be incremented on each iteration on a range of 20. We can change the range for a bigger one or a smaller one by changing the number inside the parenthesis. Note that a line of code will be inside the loop, if it is indented by four spaces. For example, run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(10):
    print "I am inside the loop"

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the string "I am OUTSIDE" was printed only once, because it is outside the loop. To be inside the loop the code needs to be indented by 4 spaces, as we said. Once we use a line of code that is not indented for the first time after the loop, that is considered the end of the loop. If you try to indent a line after the loop has finished, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(20):

    print "I am outside 2"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That would cause a syntax error when you run it. A syntax error means that the code is not complying with the way python should be written. In this case, would specifically show an indentation error:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">python helloworld.py

    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That happens because we put and indentation, and the for loop was already closed. Syntax errors at the beginning can happen to you by accident and you might not fix them very easily, but with a little time you will begin to fix them quickly if they happen. To practice, spot the syntax error in the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(20):
    prin "I am inside the loop"
    print i

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is the error?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run it to see what happens. It will show:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">python helloworld.py

SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Python shows you the line with the error, but not the exact location. In this case we missed the 't' from 'print'. Another error might be that the colon from the for loop is missing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(20)

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you add the missing colon after range(20), the program should work. A syntax error can happen because any reserved word is misspelled; remember that reserved words are words that python recognize as instructions. For example, 'print', 'for', 'in' are reserved words in our program. Additionally, a syntax error can happen because of a missing symbol such as a colon.</p>

<p>The program should print the numbers from 0 to 9.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we have seen how a computer can repeat an instruction several times, which is something fundamental in a computer. We want computers to do repetitive tasks for us. Another fundamental functionality we want in computers is conditional clauses. A conditional clause means that a program will do an action only if a condition is met or take another path if the condition is not met. For example, suppose you are printing the numbers from 0 to 9, and you want to print a message when the number is less than 5 and another message when the number is equal or greater than 5. You would do it in the following manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(10):
    if i&lt;5:
        print "The following number is less than 5"
    if i&gt;=5:
        print "The following number is greater than or equal to 5"
    print i</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run it and verify the results. We have introduced an if-clause, which is a conditional clause. Note that all the code is inside the loop. The first message is inside the first if-clause, that is only fulfilled when 'i' is less than 5. The second message is inside the second if-clause, which is only fulfilled when the 'i' is greater than or equal to 5. At last, we print the variable 'i', which is not inside any if-clause, so it is always printed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to implement this program, is using an 'else':</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">for i in range(10):
    if i&lt;5:

    else:
        print "The following number is greater than or equal to 5"
    print i</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When then condition in an if-clause is not met, it enters the 'else' to execute what is inside. You should still see this output when you run the program:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">python helloworld.py

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a piece of code that you want to use often, copy pasting that piece of code is a bad idea because your code gets longer and for a human becomes harder to read. On the other hand, if you want to make a modification in that piece of code, you will have to modify every part in which you copy and pasted that code. We can overcome that by using functions. A function can receive parameters, which are variables you pass to the function so operations with them can be done. Additionally, a function can return a value, which is the result after all the operations are done. Let’s see an example of a function that verifies if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will return True. If it is odd, it will return False. The program receives any number you input and verifies such an input. Note that the '%' operator in the code, is the modulo operator, which calculates the remainder. In this case we calculate the remainder of x divided by 2 and compare that to zero to determine if the number is even or odd. Read the code to understand!</p>

<h3 id="_input_and_output">3.3. Input and output</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A program might need to have interactions with a user. For example, a calculator expects that the user enters some numbers to then do the processing. Receiving user input in a terminal is very easy in python because it has predefined functions that do it for us. The function ‘input()’ waits until the user writes something in the terminal and presses enter. Note that a function can have zero parameters. Then, the function returns the string that the user wrote, and we assign it to the variable number_iterations’. Here is an example, in which we allow the user to control the number of iterations of our program:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">print "Input the number of iterations:"
number_iterations = input()
for i in range(number_iterations):

        print "The following number is less than 5"
    else:
        print "The following number is greater than or equal to 5"
    print i</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run that program. When you run it, it will do nothing until you input a number in the terminal and press enter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other cases, the data we want to input does not have to come from the user. It could come from a file. We can read all the lines from a file using the function 'open'. Create a file called “pico.txt” in the same folder that you are creating the python programs. Then, in that file copy and paste this text:</p>

<p>As you saw, this program reads a file and enumerates each line in the output. The 'open' function has two parameters, the first one is the path of the file you want to open, and the second has a string with the letter 'r', which means that we want to <strong>r</strong>ead the file. 'my_file' is just the name of the file we want to read. Then, we can iterate over each of the lines of the file in a for loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this is all made inside a 'with' block. We use the 'with' statement before opening a file to close the file automatically after reading. Also, to handle possible exceptions during the execution. What that means is that when you open a file, you must close it and make sure that it closes correctly. For example, if you do my_file.close(), that would close the file. Imagine that along the way before calling close, something happens and you never get to the line in which you close the file, so you left it open accidentally. Later we will give you more details on exceptions. For the time being, just think of 'with' as an easy way to ensure that the file will be closed correctly.</p>

For example, if we have the string "hello" and the integer 123, and we want to create a string that is "hello123", we can concatenate those two values. But first, we need to convert the integer to string, otherwise python will show an error. To concatenate strings, we use the operator '+'. When we add two strings, python will concatenate them. When we add two integers, python will do a mathematical addition. To represent a break of line in a string, we use "\n".</p>

<h3 id="_comments">3.4. Comments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a good practice to explain what your code is doing in a comment. In that way, the reader of the code, which may be yourself, will understand what some part of the code is doing. You will realize that when you write some code, you will forget the exact logic and you will have to read it again to understand what you did. In summary, comments are something very important in programming. In python, you write a comment by adding the '#' symbol at the beginning of any line of your code. This line, will be ignored by the python interpreter as it did not exist, so it does nothing in the program. See the following example:</p>

         # we only print this message when the value of i is less than 5
        print "The following number is less than 5"

<h3 id="_try_except_and_exceptions">3.5. Try-except and exceptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exceptions are useful in hacking in several cases, for example, when you want an attack to keep executing even if an unknown error occurred. When a program tries to execute an instruction that even though it has a correct syntax, it cannot be done for some other reason, an exception is thrown. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, that can have the correct syntax to do it, but when the program is executing the line it will stop and fail. Let’s do the experiment:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">num1=8

print "The program keeps executing to do other stuff..."</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the program divides 8 by any number input by the user. If you run it and input for example 2, nothing bad will happen, and you will see this:</p>

<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">Input the number that will divide:

    result=num1/num2
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An error ocurred because you cannot divide by zero. That is a rule of python and most programming languages. Your program will stop when an error happens, further lines will not be executed. In this case, you could verify that the number is not zero in an if-clause. For this example, let’s fix the program instead using a try-except:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">num1=8
print "Input the number that will divide:"

except:
    print "An error has occurred, did you try to divide by zero?")
print("The program keeps executing to do other stuff...")</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our previous code, you would print the same message for any error. Try to input a string instead of 0. It will show the same message. If you want to be more specific, you can catch specific errors in the following manner:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">num1=8

    print "Do not divide by zero, that is forbidden."
except TypeError:
    print "Your input value must be an integer."
print "The program keeps executing to do other stuff..."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now when you input a string, it will show this:</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that when an error occurs, the following lines inside the 'try' block will not execute. See that 'result' is not printed, and that makes sense because there was no result to print. The program jumps into the ‘except’ block immediately.</p>

<p>For example, in the ASCII table, you can see that the @ symbol is represented as the 64 number in decimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The table also has a column called Hx or Hexadecimal, which is base 16. Decimal is base 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decimal base is the one we use in everyday life. Which likely comes from the fact that humans have 10 fingers. Therefore, we have 10 different symbols to represent all different numbers. In computers, it is helpful to have a base with 16 symbols, because it translates easier to binary. You probably know that most computers physically store only binary numbers, which are represented only by 0 and 1. A binary digit is called a bit. Although computers use binary, base 16 is easy to translate from binary for us humans.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hexadecimal base (or base 16) has the following symbols:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web exploits are a nice starting point to dive into the world of hacking. Chances are that you are familiar with a web browser, so you will feel you are working on something that you already know!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_html">4.1. Html</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before diving into Web Exploits, you need to understand how a website works. Many years ago, the web was used to visit static pages that did not have interactive features; they just showed information. To do a static page, it is enough to write some lines of HTML. What is HTML? First, it is not a programming language. Html means HyperText Markup Language, and we use it to determine the font size, colors, margins, or similar features in a web page. When an html file is accessed in a browser like Firefox, Chrome or whichever browser you like, the browser presents the text according to the html on it. Your browser can access an html file locally. Locally means that the file could be in your laptop or file system. In contrast, it could access the file remotely through the Internet. Let&#8217;s see an example of creating a simple html and access it locally:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>On your computer, create a folder called "picoexample" and then, inside that folder, create a text file and name it "myFirstPage.html". You can do this on Notepad on Windows, Textedit on Mac, or any text editor from Linux. It is important that the extension is ".html". It cannot be ".html.txt" or something that is not exactly ".html". If you don&#8217;t see the extension in your operating system, this is a good opportunity to google how to make it appear to be able to modify it. Remember, for obstacles that might appear along the way, google is the answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the content in a text editor and write: Hello World!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the file in any browser. To do that, you can right click on the file, and then select "open with" and choose the browser you want. You should see a page like the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image13.png" alt="image" width="624" height="46">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Hello World! page</div>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Now, in the text editor, modify the content of the file and replace the text by: &lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the file on the text editor. Then, open the file in the browser again, or you can simply click refresh on your browser. Since it already has opened the file, you will see the message in bold, similar to this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image27.png" alt="image" width="624" height="46">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Hello World! page in bold</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You just created a page with a very simple HTML that made your message appear in bold. Note that &lt;b&gt; is the opening tag, &lt;/b&gt; is the closing tag. Analyze the difference between the opening and closing tag. What do you see? The closing tag is usually the same as the opening tag, but you include "/" like we just did. We just used an html tag to tell the browser we want some specific text in bold. Html is just a bunch of tags that allow us to do similar things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s make a page with more fields so you can get a sense of tags and the structure of a bigger page. Use the following HTML code to replace the content of the file you are editing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;This is a picoCTF html Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;This is a smaller Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
   The following is an image:&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;img src="picologo.png" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you did before, save the file in the text editor and click refresh on the browser. You probably see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image17.png" alt="image" width="624" height="496">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. Headings of different size and broken image</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you read the html code and try to analyze its content, you will realize the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The title shown in that tab of the browser "This is a picoCTF html Example", appears there because you put that text inside in the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; Is used to create a big heading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; creates a heading smaller than &lt;h1&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &lt;header&gt; tags are used to group introductory content, in this case the title, but if you remove this tag, you will not see much change in our page. Do the experiment of removing it. If you only remove the opening or closing tag it will cause an html error, so make sure to delete the opening tag and closing tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &lt;body&gt; tags are used to group the main content of the page. If you remove them you will not see much change in our page because we have just a few things. However, in several cases you might break a page completely if you remove a tag without proper care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have noted the &lt;img&gt; tag is not showing any image as it should. Why? Let&#8217;s analyze the element img:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;img src="picologo.png" /&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First you see there is not opening or closing tag, there is just one tag with the slash at the right-hand side. This is ok for an image. As you can see, it has an <strong>attribute</strong> called "src", which means source. We are assigning to "src" the value "picologo.png". Our html is going to try to access a file called "picologo.png" in the same folder where "myFirstPage.html" is contained, which is the folder we name at first "picoexample". There is no image called "picologo.png", so the browser has nothing to show. Copy and paste an image to the folder and name it "picologo.png". The extension of the image has to be ".png". If you have an image with a different extension, you can just use the extension you need in the "src" attribute in your html. For example, if the extension of the image you have is ".jpg" you can simply replace</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;img src="picologo.png" /&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>with</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;img src="picologo.jpg" /&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you successfully created the image in the folder, and refresh the browser you will see the following, of course, with your own custom image:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image22.png" alt="image" width="624" height="496">

<div class="title">Figure 7. Custom image</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fundamental part of web sites are the links. The link tag is <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong>, the following is an example of a link directed to google:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;a href="http://google.com" &gt; Go to google! &lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use that element and put it in your code to make a link to the web site you want. Now practice by adding more html tags and images in your page! This is a reference in which you can find more html tags:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/, window="_blank"</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_javascript">4.2. JavaScript</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make pages more interactive JavaScript is commonly used. JavaScript is a programming language! We can do algorithms using it. JavaScript is executed in your browser. For example, when you visit a website, the JavaScript code is downloaded along the HTML and it only executes once it is loaded in your browser. When you visit a page, you are downloading an html file and your browser interprets the tags and prints the text and images as we learned before. This image illustrates that process:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image26.png" alt="image" width="624" height="357">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 8. Client to server communication</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If that file happens to contain JavaScript, your browser will execute it. Let&#8217;s look at an example. In the same folder "picoexample", create a file called "myFirstJS.html" using a text editor. Then, put the following content in the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;This is a picoCTF JS Example&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            alert("Hello picoCTF");
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript example&lt;/h1&gt;&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Save the file. As soon as you open the page, you will see an alert showing "Hello picoCTF", something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image5.png" alt="image" width="624" height="496">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 9. Alert "hello picoCTF"</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you analyze the file, you will note that the magic is happening in this element:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;script&gt;
    alert("Hello picoCTF");
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever you put inside the tags "&lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt;" will be tried to execute by the browser as JavaScript. Since JavaScript is a programming language, we should be able to do some arithmetic. Replace the string "Hello picoCTF" by an arithmetic operation, like 8*8, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;script&gt;
    alert(8*8);
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we only use quotes when we want to use a string. In arithmetic operations we don&#8217;t use quotes. Save the file and refresh the browser. You should see the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image18.png" alt="image" width="624" height="496">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 10. Arithmetic result</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click Ok in the alert message to make it go away. Anything you write in JavaScript or html will be visible for any user that accesses your page in a browser. To see the html and JavaScript code in your browser right click the page and then "View Page Source"</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image10.png" alt="image" width="402" height="296">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 11. Right click to view page source</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see the JavaScript code you just wrote:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 12. HTML source code</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a very important thing! Never put a secret in your JavaScript code or html. If someone does it, that will be a vulnerability in your page. As a hacker you can try to look for secrets on the html of a page you want to exploit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s use some more elaborated code. We are going to make a page that adds two numbers input by the user and shows the result in an alert. We will explain its code in detail later. The code is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;This is a picoCTF JS Example&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            function myFunctionSum(){
                var number1 = document.getElementById("number1").value;
                var number2 = document.getElementById("number2").value;
                var result = number1 + number2;
                alert(result);
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript example to add2 numbers&lt;/h1&gt;
        Input the first number&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="number1"  &gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Input the second number&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="number2" &gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;button onclick="myFunctionSum()"&gt; Show alert! &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Put it on a text file, save it, and open it on a browser as usual. You should see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image3.png" alt="image" width="492" height="390">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 13. Add two numbers</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you put the numbers in each text field, and click "show alert!", you will see the alert with the result. For this example let&#8217;s input 4 and 2 in the text fields, you should see:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/image23.png" alt="image" width="510" height="405">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 14. Alert result</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you know what the page does, let&#8217;s analyze the new lines of the code. In this line we have an input tag:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;input type="text" id="number1" &gt;&lt;br&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, it is of type text, and it has an "id" with the value of "number1". The value of the "id", in this case "number1", is something we arbitrarily define to be able to access the content of this text input in JavaScript. This line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;button onclick="myFunctionSum()"&gt; Show alert! &lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is responsible for calling the function "myFunctionSum()" when the button is clicked. A function is just a piece of code that we can define, so whenever is called it executes the code inside. In this case, we named the function "myFunctionSum", but is is possible to give it any name. The function has to be defined inside the script tags. Try to read the function and understand at a general level what each line is doing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="javascript">function myFunctionSum(){
    var number1 = document.getElementById("number1").value;
    var number2 = document.getElementById("number2").value;
    var result = number1 + number2;
    alert(result);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Challenge! Modify the file to multiply the two numbers. When you are done with that, include a new third input number to multiply three different numbers! At this point you should be able to do it on your own. Be careful with the syntax, remember that a single character wrong might break the whole code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_server_code">4.3. Server code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we said previously, JavaScript is executed only in the browser. What if you want to do calculations and store data in the remote server? For example, when you login into a Website, your user and password has to be verified on the server. The password is stored in the server and should not travel outside of it for the sake of security. If you would verify a password on JavaScript, you would be able to see it on your browser in the same way you can see any JavaScript, and that would be very insecure. There are several programming languages that can be executed on the server, for instance:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PHP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C Sharp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And many more&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For our examples, we will begin using PHP, not because we think is a great language, but because a huge number of websites on the Internet use it and it is very easy to learn and deploy. In any case, as a hacker, you would generally have to learn all the languages you can because different websites are made on different languages, as well as CTF challenges that try to simulate real life! The more a language is used, the more likely you will have to attack a website made with it. However, the vulnerabilities we will be explaining can happen in any programming language, because they are not a fault of the language, but a fault of the programmer that did the website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you have a text file named hello.php, containing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="html">&lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;script&gt; alert('Hello World from JavaScript!'); &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;?php
    echo "Hello World from PHP!";
?&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in a file with the extension .php you can mix html, JavaScript, and PHP code! If the server supports PHP, everything inside <strong>&lt;?php ?&gt;</strong> will be understood as PHP code and run by the server, not by the browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look at the following image carefully to understand what happens:</p>

<p>If you open a file with that content on your laptop, the PHP code will not be executed, because your laptop is not a PHP server (if you have not made it one). So, to execute PHP you need to make your laptop a server. But for the time being, we can use the following:</p>

<p>According to what you have learned so far, that time is from the clock on your computer? Or the time of the clock in the server?</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s make an experiment, and add another line with this php code:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That string echoed in PHP has JavaScript code. Is the JavaScript alert shown? What happened? As expected, anything printed on php, will become an integral part of the html downloaded file, so the JavaScript will be executed. This opens the door for the famous attack of Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you Login into a Website, the website needs a way to know that any request coming from your browser is coming from a user that previously logged in, without the need to send the user-password again. To do that, the website can send to your browser a secret random value after login. That value is generally stored in a cookie or in JavaScript local storage. For this example, let&#8217;s pretend it is stored in a cookie, which is simply a variable in your browser that can retain data. If a Website sets a specific cookie in your browser, your browser automatically re-sends that cookie in each request to the website. If a website only uses cookies to retain a session, and if a hacker can steal the authentication cookie from you, they could pretend to be you! Note that only using cookies for autentication will open the possibility of Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), but this will be explained later, for now let&#8217;s focus on XSS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you are a hacker in a social network. When you create your account, instead of using your name, you input JavaScript code. When a friend of yours visit your profile, the WebSite will try to print your name, but your name is actually JavaScript code, so the browser might execute that JavaScript code. In that way, you could execute your own JavaScript on your friend&#8217;s browser!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you get to execute JavaScript in someone else&#8217;s browser, you can read their authentication data, which can be a secret value placed on a cookie or JavaScript local storage after a user logs in. At that point, your friend&#8217;s account would probably be compromised!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important skill to have, is to use the browser debugger. For this explanation we will use Firefox. You can download an install Firefox here:</p>

<p>A library is a set of functions that allow us to do some actions in an easier manner. In this case, it allow us to do requests and send data from JavaScript to a server. We are just sending the cookie to a remote service that is made to receive cookies from this exercise. That service receives two variables: "cookie" and "hackername". The value of the variable cookie will be "document.cookie". Here, instead of "=", we use ":" to assign a value to a variable. Using document.cookie you access the cookies from JavaScript, so that should contain the cookie you want to steal. The variable hackername simply has  a name assigned. You could replace the string "YourName" with your actual name. Remember that a string must be inside quotes in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The function:</p>

<h2 id="_cryptography">5. Cryptography</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptography is an ancient field that dates to Ancient Rome. Etymologically, the word traces back to the Greek roots "kryptos" meaning "hidden" and "graphein" meaning "to write." It is used to communicate secretly in the presence of an enemy. With cryptography we can achieve the following properties when a message is sent:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*Confidentiality: No one unintended will be able to read the message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*Integrity: If a message is tampered, it is possible to detect that it was.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*Authentication: It can be verified accurately the identity of someone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*Nonrepudiation: If a person sent a specific message, then the person cannot deny that the message was sent by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we will see how to achieve Confidentiality. This is done with encryption. When we want to hide a message, we say that we encrypt the message. To understand how encryption works, we will see an example of an ancient way of encrypting a message that is not secure by any means today, but it is good for illustration. But first, to practice our terminal skills, we will encrypt a folder in linux to prevent anyone could read its contents without the appropriate password.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_practical_example">5.1. Practical example</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use cryptography in real life, you should never use your own implementations. To begin, we will demonstrate how to encrypt a file, without any knowledge in cryptography. Go to the shell server in its web version at:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are there, create a file called 'my_name.txt' containing your name. You could use the 'nano' editor, but in linux it is possible to do the following trick: If your name was 'samuel', you would run the following command to create the text file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">echo "samuel" &gt; my_name.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'echo' command simply outputs a string, and we are redirecting that output to a file. For example, if we just run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">echo "samuel"</code></pre>

<p>We will move both files to a new folder, then compress that folder, and then encrypt it! Compressing a folder just makes several files or folders to appear a single file, and they would take less space on disk, but compressing does not provide any security. Anyone would be able to simply decompress it and see the original content. However, encryption will do prevent obtaining the original content without the key. To do that experiment, create a directory called my info:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">mkdir my_info</code></pre>

<p>It is not possible to obtain the original content without the password, because such a password is used to do operations with the content to obtain as a result the encrypted file. At this point you might have no idea of what happened. There are many algorithms for encryption, that were created since the antique Rome. Old ways of encrypting data are easily broken nowadays. Even relatively new ways of encrypting data are broken easily today. Some of them are considered unbreakable right now, but will be broken in the future.  Let&#8217;s begin to understand how encryption works!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_substitution_ciphers">5.2. Substitution ciphers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Cipher" means a secret or disguised way of writing a message. It can be thought as the same as encryption. One cipher method invented in the antique Rome and named after the emperor Julius Caesar who used it for his private communication is Caesar&#8217;s cipher. This cipher simply substitutes each of the letters of a word by another one that is a certain number of positions further in the alphabet. That "certain number of positions" is called the shift. For example, if we have the word "hello" and we want to encrypt it using Caesar&#8217;s cipher with a shift of 3, we would replace the 'h' by 'k' because 'k' is 3 positions further in the alphabet, the 'e' by 'h' for the same reason, and so on. We called the original text we want to encrypt the cleartext or plaintext. The result of encrypting 'hello' using Caesar&#8217;s with a shift of 3, is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>cleartext &#8594; h e l l o</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encrypted text &#8594; k h o o r</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Decrypting" means obtaining the clear text from the encrypted text. For Caesar&#8217;s cipher we simply do the same but in reverse; we subtract 3 positions in the alphabet to each letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that when we get to the end of the alphabet after adding positions while encrypting something, we simply overlap the alphabet. For example, to encrypt the letter 'z', we would encrypt it using the letter 'c'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make sure you understand the decryption, decrypt the following text using Caesar cipher with a shift of 3:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>s l f r f w i</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result is something you probably know. Hint: the first decrypted letter is 'p' .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Caesar&#8217;s cipher is a <strong>substitution cipher</strong>, because it replaces each letter by something else. In a substitution cipher, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to replace a letter by another letter. You can use any symbol if you know how to reverse it.</p>

<p>Read the comments in the python source code to understand it. You probably noted the '%', which is called the modulo operator. That allows us to wrap around a number, because it calculates the remainder of the division. We will see more detail of this in the future, so do not worry too much about it for now. But, know that if we want a number to start from 0 again if it surpasses certain threshold, we can use modulo operator. In this case, we use it because we only have 26 letters in the english alphabet. So, the first position is 0, which contains 'a', because arrays start at zero. The last position is 25, which contains 'z'. So, if we want to encrypt 'z', we would need to add 3 positions, and 25+3 is 28, but after 25 we need to begin from 0 again because of the way that caesar works. Modulo operator works perfect for that because:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>26%26 is 0
27%26 is 1
28%16 is 2</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, as we said before in an example, the letter 'z' would be encrypted with 'c', which is in the position 2 considering that arrays start at 0. Other thing that you maybe did not understand at once from the code, was that we subtracted 97 from the ASCII value. Go to:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the letter 'a', is in the position 97, so we simply subtract 97 to apply the overlap trick with modulo 26. Note that this trick would also work by not subtracting 97, but instead applying the modulo on 123, like in the following code:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In transposition ciphers, we don&#8217;t replace the letters by other symbols, but we simply change the order in which they appear on the cleartext. For example, we can decide that our encryption algorithm simply moves the letters to the right and overlaps. Let&#8217;s encrypt the word 'pico' by rotating its letters by one position to the right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a very simple kind of transposition. But you can have a map that makes more complicated transpositions. For instance, you can decide that you will encrypt a text by doing transpositions in chunks of 6 letters using the following mapping:</p>

<p>The number indicate the position of the letters. Using that mapping, let&#8217;s encrypt the word 'pico'. Since pico only has 4 letters, we can simply use a padding to complete until 6 letters. For this example, we will use the symbol * as padding, so we have:</p>

<p>So far, we saw how transposition and substitution ciphers work. If they are used only by themselves, they are very easy to crack. On the other hand, if someone finds out the algorithm we use to encrypt, the encryption is broken forever! A way to improve this, is by using encryption algorithms based on a key.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_key_ciphers">5.4. Key ciphers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a principle in cryptography called the Kerckhoffs&#8217;s principle that states: "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge". That principle pretends to overcome the fact that once the encryption algorithm is known by the enemy the encryption is broken. The solution is to use a key. One old algorithm that was used to encrypt data using a key was "Vigenere". It looks certainly stronger than the previous algorithms we learned. Even though it is easily breakable nowadays, in its time it was considered unbreakable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand how Vigenere works we will encrypt the cleartext:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I LOVE PITTSBURGH"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we remove the spaces, because the Vigenere table does not have the  space. However, a human can easily recognize the words of a text even if it has no spaces. We get:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"ILOVEPITTSBURGH"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, we can pick a key. For this example, we will use the key "PICOCTF". Since our text is larger than the key, we simply repeat the key several times until we get the same length in the following manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plaintext: ILOVEPITTSBURGH</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key: PICOCTFPICOCTFP</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first letter of the cleartext is paired with the first letter of the key. So, we have the pair ('I','P') Now in the vigenere table that is presented below, we use row i and column p. The cell at the intersection of the column and the row will be the encrypted letter, which in this case is X. We do the same for the rest of the letters, and we would obtain the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cleartext: ILOVEPITTSBURGH</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>Key: PICOCTFPICOCTFP</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encrypted text: XTQJGINIBUPWKLW</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We take the first letter of the key, which is 'P', and go to that row in the vigenere table. Then in the row 'P', we find the first letter of the encrypted text, which is 'X'.The column that corresponds to 'X', is the first letter of the clear text, which in our case is 'I'. You repeat the same process for each character until you get 'ILOVEPITSBURGH'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To verify that you understand the decryption, decrypt the encrypted text "WMNZQAJ" using the key "HELLO", remember that if the key is shorter, you just repeat it. You should obtain a word you will easily recognize!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In modern cryptography exist the concept of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography means that you use the same key for encryption and decryption like we just did on Vigenere. In asymmetric cryptography you have two keys. One is for encryption, known as the public key, the other one is for decryption, known as the private key. Asymmetric cryptography is useful because it can be used to solve the problem of a key exchange. Additionally, it can be applied for digital signatures that provide integrity and non-repudiation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_symmetric_crypto_example_aes">5.5.1. Symmetric crypto example: AES</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A commonly used algorithm today for symmetric cryptography, is AES, which means "Advanced Encryption Standard". This algorithm has a combination of substitutions and transpositions using a key of fixed length. A key of fixed length means that the algorithm can only have a key with a certain size. However, AES has different versions and each version can support a key length of different sizes. The most common versions are AES 128 and AES 256, which have a key length of 128 bits and AES 256 respectively. AES algorithm is considered secure. However, the implementation can be attacked successfully if it has flaws. For example, one famous way to break AES encryption is the Padding Oracle Attack, which allows to successfully crack SSL, an encrypted protocol that was widely used to secure HTTP traffic. However, this is not a weakness of AES, but a weakness in how it is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AES has different operation modes. We will analyze two of them to illustrate vulnerabilities that can emerge in their use. This operation modes are "ECB" and "CBC".</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_operation_mode_ecb">Operation mode ECB</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ECB means Electronic Code Book. In this operation mode we encrypt independently blocks of the clear text according to the key length. For example, if we are using AES 128, we break the clear text in chunks of 128 bits and use AES to encrypt them independently. This causes a problem because it leaks structure in the encrypted text. There is a famous example on the internet about an image of Tux (the penguin from linux) encrypted using AES in ECB operation mode:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="title">Figure 25. Encrypted penguin using ECB, we still see it, which is bad</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yow can see that is easy to identify that the encrypted image contains the penguin. In other cases, this operation mode can be very bad for other reasons. Suppose you are sending an encrypted text and you know that the first 128 bits contain a name and the second 128 bits contain a date. Imagine that you are an attacker that captures some encrypted messages on different dates. Even if you do not know the key, you could be able to interchange the second block of messages to tamper the date. To understand this better let&#8217;s look at an example. Suppose you intercept a message sent on May 1, and after some days you intercept another message in on May 8.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you want to make the receiver think that the second message is from May 1. You could simply replace the blue block by the red block.</p>

<img src="images/5image3.png" alt="5image3">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 26. Blocks of message</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another problem of ECB is that if you send the same message twice, any attacker can see that the same message is being sent again. A secure encryption algorithm should not leak any information about the message. Knowing that the same message was sent in the past can be used to learn details about the communication. It is recommended to never use ECB.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_operation_mode_cbc">Operation mode CBC</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more secure operation mode is CBC, which means Cipher Block Chaining. In this mode we include additional elements. The first one is the initialization vector, a random value with the same size as the key. In AES, the key size is the same as the block size. Remember that in AES we must separate the cleartext in blocks with the same size as the key. Before starting the encryption, we do XOR between the first block of cleartext and the Initialization Vector, then we begin to encrypt using AES with the key of our choice. The initialization vector is different for every message, so if we send the same message twice, it will be different due to the initialization vector. We must attach the initialization vector to the message. Another element we add in this operation mode, is that we do not encrypt blocks independently, but we use the encrypted text from one block and XOR it with the next block of cleartext we want to encrypt. Then, we use AES and the key to encrypt that result. In the following image it is shown the graphical representation of what it was just explained, note that the circle with the cross means XOR:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 27. CBC diagram</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In AES, the cleartext must be the same size as a multiple of the block size. For example, if you have a cleartext that happens to be shorter than a block, you need to add padding to the cleartext so it matches at least one block. In a case where cleartext is larger than one block, but smaller than two, you need to add padding to the cleartext until it is the same size as two blocks. In AES there is a common way of padding, which is a standard called PKCS #7. In AES 128, as we said previously, the block size is 128 bits, which is equivalent to 16 bytes. Suppose you want to encrypt the message</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"HELLOPICOCTF"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since that message is 12 bytes, we require to add a padding of 4 bytes to complete the size of a block. In PKCS#7 you add padding using a byte with the value of bytes you need to pad. In our example, since we need to pad 4 bytes to complete 16 bytes, we would pad like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"HELLOPICOCTF"+"\x04\x04\x04\x04"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that "\x" is a way to tell that in a string we want to use that exact number on a byte, even if it is not printable ASCII. Now, suppose we want to encrypt a message of 14 bytes like:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"GOODBYEPICOCTF!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After we pad it using PKCS#7, the result is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"GOODBYEPICOCTF!"+"\x01"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What would be the result after padding the message "BYEPICOCTF"?</p>

<h4 id="_asymmetric_crypto_example_rsa">5.5.2. Asymmetric crypto example: RSA</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that asymmetric crypto, means that we use one key for encrypting (the public key) and another key for decrypting (the private key). Suppose you want to communicate secretly with asymmetric crypto. In that case, you generate a public and private key pair. Then, give the public key to anyone that wants to send you an encrypted message. They will encrypt the message using your public key and when you receive the encrypted message, you are the only one that can decrypt it, because you are the only one that has the private key. That&#8217;s why it is called "private". Note that your public key can be of public knowledge and no one would be able to decrypt the message. If you want to send an encrypted message to someone, that person would have to give you their public key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very widely used algorithm for asymmetric cryptography is RSA. It is called RSA because of its inventors: Ronald <strong>R</strong>ivest, Adi <strong>S</strong>hamir, and Leonard <strong>A</strong>dleman. To understand how it works, we will encrypt and decrypt using RSA algorithm with a public-private key pair that was generated for this example; it will seem a bit magical. After that, we will understand some concepts, learn to generate keys, and encrypt and decrypt with the generated keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before encrypting, you need to understand how it works the modulo operation if you do not know already. It is actually very simple. The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example, 8 mod 3 = 2, because 3 fits in 8 two times, and we have a reminder of 2. Since RSA uses very basic arithmetic, we are ready to see the example. In RSA, the public key is a pair of numbers, as well as the private key. The message can be anything that we can represent as a number. In a computer, everything is a number as we know. The encrypted text, also called ciphertext, will be another number. In summary, this what we need in RSA to encrypt and decrypt:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSA public key: Is a pair of numbers (e,n)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSA private key: Is a pair of numbers (d,n)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message: m</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ciphertex: c</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To encrypt: m<sup>e</sup> mod n = c</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To decrypt: c<sup>d</sup> mod n = m</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, 'd' is the private value of the private key, since 'n' is also in the public key. As you just saw, the formulas are very simple. To encrypt a message, you simply take the message to the power of 'e', and then do modulo 'n'. To decrypt, take the ciphertext to the power of 'd', and then do modulo 'n', and that would result in the original message. In this example the numbers of the keys are very small, which is insecure in real life. RSA is only secure when large values are used. By 2019, RSA is considered secure only if the key is a number that would take at least 2048 bits. Which is roughly <strong>617 digits</strong>. This is how it looks as a 617 digit number:</p>

<p>10<sup>11</sup> mod 117</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of that is 82. So, we have:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was a bit magical. The RSA private and public key are generated with steps that make them have this property. The process of key generation is relatively simple. We only need to understand some parts of it to show our attack. Note that "In number theory, two integers a and b are said to be relatively prime, mutually prime, or coprime (also written co-prime) if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is 1. Consequently, any prime number that divides one does not divide the other. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor (gcd) being 1"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. The multiplicative inverse is a number that we use to multiply another number, and obtain 1 as a result. For example, in non-integer arithmetic (in RSA we only use integer arithmetic) the multiplicative inverse of 8, is 1/8, Because 8 * 1/8=1. However, in integer arithmetic we don&#8217;t have fractions. But we can have a multiplicative inverse modulo n, which means that if we have a number, multiply it by its multiplicative inverse, and take modulo n, the result will be 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the multiplicative inverse in 3 modulo 4, is 3, Why? Because if you multiply 3*3, that results in 9, and 9 modulo 4, is 1. Now you are ready to see the key generation without getting lost. This is it:</p>

<p>It is relatively simple! To find a multiplicative inverse, you can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). In google it is easy to find an online implementation of it. Remember our example in which we had these key pair?</p>

<h5 id="_attacking_rsa">Attacking RSA</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSA can be easily broken if it has a small 'n'. This does not happen often in real life, unless a programmer decides to implement their own version of RSA. A programmer should not make their own implementations of cryptography, it is a general rule to use libraries tested by industry. The security of RSA is based on the fact that there is not an efficient algorithm to factorize a large 'n', so an attacker is not able to generate the private key from the public key. In case 'n' is too small, it is possible to factorize it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are going to see how to break RSA by recovering the private key from the public. In real life, the public key comes in a digital certificate, which is a package that contains data related to the owner of the public key along with the public key itself. Digital certificates are often encoded in base64, which is a way of encoding a binary as a printable text. The following is an example of a digital certificate encoded in base64:</p>

<h4 id="_hashing">5.5.3. Hashing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you want to download a big file from the internet. However, after downloading, you want to check that every bit of the file is correct, and nothing was changed because of a transmission error or a malicious attacker. To do this, you can use a hash, which is a value that you get after applying a hash function to the file, and you obtain a string of fixed length that identifies that file. Whenever you apply the hash function to the file, you will get exactly the same hash, unless the file has been modified. If one bit of the file was changed, you would get a very different hash. So, using a hash we can check the integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several hash functions used in industry that are considered secure. One that is commonly used, is SHA2, which means "Secure Hashing Algorithm 2", because it is the second version of SHA. Let&#8217;s look at an example. Open the shell server and create a file called "bio.txt" and copy paste the following content (do not include the quotes and make sure there is not break line at the end or beginning):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Charles Babbage KH FRS (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Save it, and run the command "sha256sum" like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="text">sha256sum bio.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, you should get a hex string of 64 characters. In this particular text, you should get:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That string is an identification for the information contained in our file. If we make just a little change to the file, it will change completely. For example, create a new file called "bio2.txt" with the same data, but now without the dot at the end:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Charles Babbage KH FRS (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Save it, and run the command "sha256sum" like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sha256sum bio2.txt</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should get:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3e7e604c81440507f6140becfed1c3510bc49cc4745c938166b9979245215618</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the hash is very different just because we removed one single dot. Now, add the dot back at the end in the file bio2.txt, and run "sha256sum" on that file. You should get the original hash that we got from "bio.txt", because the information contained in the file is the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we store a file, calculate the hash, and keep the hash with us, we could know if the file was modified by recalculating the hash and verifying that it matches with the hash we had. This is a very useful integrity measure. One caveat, is that an attacker should not have access to the place in which the hash is stored, because in that case, the attacker would be able to modify the file, recalculate the hash, and replaced the stored hash, so we would not be able to tell that the file was modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hashes are commonly used to store passwords in a database. When a user logs in, the hash of the password is calculated, and it is compared with the hash stored. If they match, we know that the user input the correct password. Note that a fundamental property of hashes is that it is impossible to get the original text from the hash. Because of this, a system administrator would not be able to learn the actual password of users if they have access to the database. In the case of a data breach, when a database is leaked, attackers would not be able to obtain the real password of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can a hash be attacked? In the case of passwords, an attacker can create a table that maps several passwords to their hash by calculating the hash of several words, for example all the words in an english dictionary. In that way, if the attacker finds a hash of the password in the database, and the password was a word present in an english dictionary, it could be possible to map it back to the original password by looking for it in the table. However, if a user picked a secure password, this attack would not work because that secure password with complexity, would not be ina dictionary. Note there are lists of commonly used passwords which contain words in several languages and modifications of them, for example, "Hello_12345". A secure password should be random characters to prevent this attack.</p>

<p>Note that in the non-encrypted zip, it is possible to spot the name 'samuel' and the lastname 'pardo', in contrast with the encrypted one. However, you can see the path of the files in both cases. Sometimes is necessary you also hide this on a zip file. That can be achieved in several ways. One of them, is encrypting the encrypted file again. Generally, encrypting something twice does not provide more security. In this particular case it does, because the file paths were not encrypted at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beware that sometimes files seem to be encrypted, but they are not, and you can recover the original content by running an algorithm without a key. For example, there are compression algorithms that make data smaller, which means they compress the data for real. Previously we called putting a file on zip compression, but you can have a zip file with or without compression. To be precise, compression is only when you make data smaller. We ran the zip command without compression. When data is compressed, it looks as encrypted because if you 'cat' it, you could not understand the contents. However, by simply running the compression algorithm without any key you can get the original content, which is obviously not secure because anyone can run it without knowing any key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point you might have no idea of what happened on the inside while doing encryption. There are many algorithms for encryption, that were created since the Ancient Rome. Old ways of encrypting data are easily broken nowadays. Even relatively new ways of encrypting data are broken easily today. Some of them are considered unbreakable right now, but will be broken in the future.  Let&#8217;s begin to understand how encryption work!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_network">6. The Network</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A network is made up of several computers connected. They can be connected through different protocols. A Protocol is a set of rules that allow two computers in a network to send and receive information. That set of rules is essential to understand what information is coming from what source, or how to send information to a particular computer in the network. To sniff traffic in a network, we will be using a tool called Wireshark, which can show the packets transmitted on a network and we can get passwords from insecure connections. But first, we will briefly explain some important things so you roughly understand the composition of a packet and can extract the parts you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_network_layers">6.1. Network Layers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The networks we commonly use today, are broken down into different layers. This design by layers assigns responsibilities to each layer to accomplish something. It is good to have a design by layers for several reasons. For example, if network engineers want to make a change in one of the layers, the impact on the other layers is minimized. Another example, is that if you are a programmer and want to connect your application with a server, you do not necessarily need to care if the user is using wifi or ethernet cable, or how the user is connection to the internet. Your application can simply trust other layers are going to take care of that and your application will have a successful connection. These are the layers, viewed in a top down approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Application layer: Responsible for handling data traffic between applications. HTTP belongs to this layer; HTTP protocol is commonly used to obtain Web Pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transport layer: Responsible for providing several connections on the same host, that means that you can have several applications on the same device and each of them can have a different connection even if it is just one device. It also defines functionalities for reliable transport. Two protocols are used on this layer. TCP (Transport Control Protocol). You use this protocol when you need to have reliable transport, this makes sure that if a piece of information was missing while being transfertransferred it is resent. HTTP from the Application layer, runs on top of TCP, because when you visit a Web Page you want to have every part of it accurately. On the other hand, when you don’t need reliable transport, but you want faster transport that does not resend parts that were missing, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used. An example when UDP is needed is for voice communication. When you are talking if a little part of the audio is missing, you do not want it to appear later in the communication because that would confuse the listener. The listener can still understand what you are saying if the part missing is small enough. Since UDP has no controls for transport, it is faster than TCP. This layer assigns a port to each connection, and that is how it tells the difference between connections in the same computer, because of the port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network layer: It provides devices with an address in the network called the IP (Internet Protocol) address, and routes information through different routers. It provides mapping between all the computers connected to the internet. When you connect to a network in some specific place, an IP is assigned to your device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data link layer: It provides communication between devices that are connected directly. Examples of protocols in the data link layer are Ethernet or WiFi. You generally use WiFi to send messages to your router directly without any other devices in between. Each device has a physical address in wifi or ethernet, known as the mac address. The mac address is used for this layer. This is not an address like the IP that can change depending on the network you are connected to. The mac address is assigned to the hardware of your network card when it is manufactured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical layer: This handles electrical pulses on the wire that represent bits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you access a browser and visit a web site, the information of the web site is downloaded in packets. Today’s Internet is fast, and you might feel that the website appears all at once. But if you download a big file, you can see that it takes some time. This happens because the file is broken down into packets that are received in your computer, and begin to accumulate, until they are all received and conform the whole file when the download is completed. Each packet contains a piece corresponding to each layer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sniffing_and_attack_example">6.2. Sniffing and attack example</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a tool called Wireshark, we can “sniff” the packets transmitted on a network. The technical term that is used to refer to a tool like Wireshark is “sniffer”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On your computer, download Wireshark from their site:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" class="bare">https://www.wireshark.org/</a><span class="[.underline"><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" class="bare">https://www.wireshark.org/</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must download the version corresponding to your operating system. It should be a very easy process, however, if you have any issue or doubt, you can Google plenty of good documentation about Wireshark.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you install and open it you should see a window similar to this:</p>
</div>

<div class="title">Figure 30. Wireshark GUI</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is the list of devices you can sniff. In this case, we want to sniff the network card you are using to connect to the internet. If you are connected to a WiFi, you should select the one that is called “WiFi”. In case you are connected to the Internet using Ethernet cable, you should select “Ethernet”. Then, click the “start capture” button on the upper left side which is circled in the following image:</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 31. Wireshark run button</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The capture now starts. If you have applications running on your computer or have website open in your browser, you will probably see several packets immediately, let the Wireshark window continue to run the packet sniffing. In your browser, navigate to the following link:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://primer.picoctf.com/vuln/web/sign_in.php" class="bare">https://primer.picoctf.com/vuln/web/sign_in.php</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see the following page:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 32. Sign-in page</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now come back to the Wireshark window. What we want to do now is finding the packets that were sent and received in your computer when you accessed the link. If there are too many packets from all the connections on your computer, this task would be too hard task without the help of a Wireshark filter. A Wireshark filter allows you to tell Wireshark that you only want to see some specific packets. You can filter by protocol, IP, strings present in your request, or anything you need that helps you find what you are looking for faster. When we accessed the link on the browser, we did an HTTP request. We can filter HTTP requests, by simply typing http on the filter textfield and pressing enter. The following image shows the results and we circled in red the textfield in which you have to type:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 33. Wireshark HTTP filter</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right below the textfield in which you typed is the packet list. We can see two packets. The first one is the request your browser sent to the server asking for the web page, so naturally it has your IP as the source, and the IP of the server as the destination. The second packet is the reply, which now has your IP as the destination and the IP of the server as the source because now the server is the one that is sending the page to you after you request it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the lower part of the window, we can see the information related to all the layers we explained previously of the currently selected packet. Now, we will send a user and password to the web site. This page in particular does not do anything after you send a password, it just receives it, but the important thing is to note that we can see the password on wireshark when we send it. In the web page, type the following in user and password respectively:www</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>picouser</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>picopassword</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Wireshark, you should see now two more packets, one in which you send the user and password, and the reply of the server. Note that the reply of the server is the same page, as we said this page does nothing. So far, we have 4 packets, and the third one is the one in which you send the user and password!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the third packet, and in the lower part of the window where the layers are visible, click “Hypertext Transfer Protocol”. Note that at the end we can see &amp;password=picopassword</p>
</div>

<div class="title">Figure 34. Sniffed password</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just found the password we sent using sniffing. A fundamental thing to note, is that we were able to do that because the website was using HTTP, instead of HTTPS which is encrypted. Encryption prevents us from understanding the contents of a packet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, we are always able to sniff the network card of our own computer. However, if we want to sniff packets from other devices connected to the same WIFI, we must do additional things because WiFi could be using encryption. We encourage you to use a second device, it can be a smartphone, to access the web page and send a password. Then in your computer use Wireshark to capture the password sent, but first you need to do two things:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enable monitor mode in Wireshark: Stop any packet capture you are doing and open the capture dialog, which is located in the upper part of the window and click “options”Choose Wifi Interface and check “monitor” as in the following image:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Decrypt WiFi connection: You can do this only if you have the password for the WiFi you are sniffing. In the following link there is a very good article that explains how to do it:</p>

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that WIFI encryption is encryption of the datalink layer, which is different to the encryption provided by HTTPS which is in the application layer. Even if you decrypt the WIFI connection, if a website is using HTTPS, you will not be able to see anything from that website on Wireshark.</p>

<p>SQL is used to create and manipulate a very common type of databases called relational databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

We are going to see some examples in a relational database management system (RDBMS) called MySQL. Once you learn the basics of SQL in any RDBMS, it is easy to apply them in others. We are going to see a very quick introduction so you are able to understand the hacks. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p>There are several online tools that you can easily find on Google to learn languages. For example, access the following web site:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can execute MySQL statements online. So, let&#8217;s create our table from the previous example on it. First, delete the code present in the editor. You should be seeing something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 36. Online MySQL engine</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can create the table using the following statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>create table user (id integer, name text, lastname text, phone text, password text);</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analyze the statement carefully. This statement creates a table called "user" with three columns. The first column is "id", and has the data type int, which means integer. The other columns are "name", "lastname", and "phone", which are of datatype text. In datatype integer, as you might guess, you can only store integers. In a datatype text, you can store strings. Put that statement in the SQL editor and hit the button "Run". If it was successful, you will see a green bar on top of the editor with the label "success". When you create tables in SQL, they are stored and become available to insert future data on them. However, in this online editor tables just survive in a single run, so in the same script we will have to create the table, insert the data, and query the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far we have created the table but it is empty. To insert a row, add the following statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>insert into user (id, name, lastname, phone, password) values (1, 'Jane', 'Doe', '200 111 1111', '123456');</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, the statement is self explanatory. It will insert each of those values in each column of user conforming a new row. Hit run, and verify it was successful. It should look like this:</p>

<h3 id="_basic_sql_injection">7.2. Basic SQL injection</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The objective of the basic SQL injection we are learning, is trying to inject an "or" expression that is always true. In that way the server code constructs a query using the user input that deceives the program into it returning the whole table. That happens, when a program is concatenating string to construct a query in the server code. The following is an example in PHP:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"<span class="lime">SELECT * FROM user where name='</span>".$name.""<span class="lime">' and password='</span>".$password.""<span class="lime">';</span>"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The red part of the query, will be concatenated with the value of the variables to conform the final query. Let&#8217;s suppose that $name is equal to "samuel", and $password is equal to "hello", the query would result in</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SELECT * FROM user where name='samuel' and password='hello';</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What would happen if the password contains a single quote? That might break the syntax of the SQL query. Even worse, it could be used to inject your own sql. For example, if the value of $password is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or '1'='1</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resultant query would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="lime">SELECT * FROM user where name='samuel' and password='</span>' <strong>or '1'='1</strong><span class="lime">';</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which is a perfectly valid query that will return the whole table. Use what you just learn here to return all the users:</p>

<p>This kind of vulnerability it is rarely present in applications. One that is more common, is the blind sql injection.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_blind_sql_injection">7.3. Blind SQL injection</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this kind of vulnerability, the application does not return all the data to you. However, it is enough that the application shows an error message saying that no data was found or that an error has occurred, to figure out the content we are looking for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To illustrate this, we are going to attack the following page:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>If we input our previous injection in the password field:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or '1'='1</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will see that the application found something and shows the message "REGISTER FOUND":</p>

<div class="title">Figure 47. Blind SQL injection</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internally, the injection deceives the application into returning records, but the application did not show us those records. That&#8217;s why it is called Blind SQL injection. We can inject SQL, but we cannot see the result!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What can we do about this? We are will try to inject a SQL to guess one character of a field at a time. Suppose we want to guess the first character of the password. If we don&#8217;t guess it, the application will return "NOTHING FOUND". If we guess it, it will return "REGISTER FOUND".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note, this is fundamental to be able to guess only one character at a time. Trying to guess a whole string at the same time, is much harder. Suppose a word is made up by a combination of the 26 characters of the alphabet. To guess only the first letter, we only have to try 26 values. However, if we try to guess the whole word, is much more complicated. To illustrate this, suppose we have a word of two letters. If we can guess one at a time, we will need at most 26 trials for the first one, and 26 trials for the second one, for a total of 52 trials. On the other hand, if we try to guess both letters at a time, we will need 26*26 trials, which is 626 trials, because they can have different combinations. If we add more characters, guessing the whole word becomes much harder because it would emerge too many possible words. Nonetheless, guessing one letter at a time, will keep being only 26 trials for each letter. The blind SQL injection is based on that fact, it will try to inject a query that only compares one character at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be able to do that, you need to know the name of the column you are trying to guess. This is not that hard, because in many cases you can infer the name of the database column based on the name of the html input. In other cases, you can leak the name if an error occurs inside the application, and in the error message the application shows the value of the columns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the page we are attacking in this example the names are the same as the html input. One column is called 'name', and the other one is called 'password'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, you know that if you inject:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or '1'='1</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will return results, but you are not learning any information. We know two column names, 'username' and password. For this example, suppose you know a user called 'picoctf' and you to get the password from that user. To narrow down the query to the row in which the user 'picoctf' information is stored, you could use:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or username='picoctf</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we do not use the <strong>'1'='1</strong> anymore because we want a statement that will filter only one user. If you inject this on the password field from the web page, you will still see:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 48. Register found after injection</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that in our injection, if the part at the right of the "or" is true, it will return results. It is true that username is equal to 'picoctf' only in the row on the picoctf!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we will add the part that compares the first character of the password. We can do that using an embedded query. An embedded query is a query inside a query. Our embedded query highlighted in red, will simply return the first character of the password. We will compare that first character with the character 'a', so we are guessing that the first character is 'a':</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or username='picoctf' and <span class="lime">(select substr(password, 1, 1))</span>='a</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you inject this, you will see that nothing is found:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 49. Nothing found after comparing with single character</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is because we did not guess the first character. If you keep trying different characters, you will find that the first character of the password is 'f', when you inject this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>' or username='picoctf' and <span class="lime">(select substr(password, 1, 1))</span>='f</strong></p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could possibly find the whole password manually, but it would take too much effort. On the other hand, you may want to obtain all the passwords in the database, or even all the fields from the database! This same process can be applied for any field… In most of the SQL engines there is a system table that contains the names of all tables and columns, so once we find a SQL injections databases we might be able to leak the whole database. For this exercise we will only obtain one password. To be more efficient, we will write a python script that does the job for us. Suppose we found the name of the table in some way. The script is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">import requests
from string import printable
accum=""
for i in range(40):

    r = requests.post("http://primer.picoctf.com/vuln/web/blindsql.php?&amp;username=WeDontCare&amp;password=' or '"
    + letter+"'=( select substr(binary password,"+str(i)+",1) from pico_blind_injection where id=1 ) and ''= '")
    if 'NOTHING FOUND...' in r.text:
      accum=accum[:-1]
      print "nope"
    else:
      print "We found the character: "+letter
print accum</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This script is just one of the many ways in which a blind SQL injection is done. With your knowledge of Python and SQL, you should be able to understand the script if you read it carefully. Note the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>'Printable' is just a string with all the printable ASCII characters, and we iterate over them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Binary' in mysql context, is just a way to specify the we want to make case sensitive comparisons. If we do not use it, we would not be able to identify if a character is lowercase or uppercase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are sending GET parameters to the web site. For this reason, we can encode them in the URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We put the <strong>select '</strong> at the end of the query to handle the closing single quote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'NOTHING FOUND&#8230;&#8203;' Is the message printed in the html, so if that is present in the html</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To clear your doubts, experiment in the SQL editor with similar queries, or do prints on the python script to make sure you understand every part of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the SQL engine, there can be several ways to inject SQL. Even Frameworks that handle the queries for you, might have vulnerabilities in some versions, or because they are used incorrectly by developers.</p>

<h2 id="_a_little_about_c_language">8. A little about C language</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could say that C programming is one of the oldest programming languages that is still widely used in industry. It was developed in 1972 by the famous Dennis Ritchie, and even after all these years, is in fact one of the most used languages. This is the case because it is very efficient and we can control very directly the resources of the machine, in contrast to other languages, such as python. However, it is a more difficult language to learn to use it correctly, and it is much more prone to errors and vulnerabilities. Even experienced programmers that have written a lot of C in their lives can make a little mistake and introduce a bad vulnerability in a program that hacker can exploit to take complete control of the machine in which the program is running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless, many people still love C. We can use it to implement programs that need to be very efficient, such as the Operating Systems, Drivers (the programs that control the hardware of devices that we connect to our computer), or Embedded Systems. You will probably not hear about an Operating System, or a Driver, fully implemented on python, at least any time soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_some_c_features">8.1. Some C features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind the following aspects of C:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In C you can access directly an address of memory, and move through it with a pointer even if you don&#8217;t have variable that is stored there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C is very prompt to vulnerabilities, as we already mentioned. We will learn to exploit those vulnerabilities. C is harder to learn and write than python, because you need to clearly understand how the memory interacts with your program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not indented as python to determine the lines of code inside a function, loop, clause, etc. For example, the lines of code inside an 'if clause', are determined by braces, not four spaces. This is an 'if clause' in python and C respectively:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python">if x&gt;5:
    print "Hello"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the same in C, would look like (the 'f' at the end of print is necessary):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">if(x&gt;5)
{
    printf("Hello");
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in C, we could do:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">if(x&gt;5)
{
printf("Hello");
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And it would work. But it is important you do not write it like that if you begin to do programming in C, because a program can become very unreadable. Always use indentations on C, even if they are not mandatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In C, you do comments using '//', instead of '#' as in python. For example, the same comment in python and C, would be:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="python"> #This is a comment in python</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c"> //This is a comment in C</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can compile C for different platforms. Compiling, means the process of translating the programing language to machine code. A computer does not understand directly the source code you write. A compiler, is a program that reads your source code, and converts it to a binary that your computer can execute. The instructions in that binary are harder to read for a human in comparison to the source code. Those instructions that the processor understands directly are called machine code. When the programs is compiled, you do not need any additional program to execute it besides the operating system. In contrast, when you run a python program, to execute it, you need the python interpreter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since C is so direct ot the machine, people often says that is like a portable Assembly. Assembly, as we will see later, is a language that is used to manipulate the instructions of the processor in your machine. Assembly changes depending of the kind of processor you are using. For example, Intel processors understand a different Assembly language than ARM processors. However, you could write the same program in C and it could work on both, because you can compile it either for ARM or for Intel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In languages like python, we do not compile the program, because python has an interpreter that translates line by line when it is being executed. That makes it slower, by a fair amount. You can do an experiment by implementing a for loop that calculates something on each iteration, and compare the result between python and C, and you will note that a python loop takes much longer than a C loop that calculate the same.</p>

<h3 id="_c_data_types">8.3. C data types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before proceeding to do more interesting programs, let&#8217;s stop to learn the data types in C. In python, you can create a variables without specifying the data type. However, in C, you need to specify it. These are fundamental data types in C:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>char: It is the data type for allocating a single character. In most of the compilers, it takes only one byte. Note that we can store any number on it, it does not have to be an actual character. Remember that a character in a computer is a number too. Since it is one byte, it can represent 256 values. As you know already, one byte is made up of 8 bits. So, 2^8 is equal to 256.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>int: It is an integer type. We can place on it an integer number, but can be much bigger as the char, because an int uses four bytes. Therefore, we can place on it, roughly, four billion values (2^32).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>float: This data type is used to store decimal numbers. In other words, numbers with a floating point value. They also take four bytes. But since they are decimals, is not that easy to show how many possible values stores. It is a  finite number of possible values of course. But for now, just know it is used for storing numbers with decimals. Since we are on a computer, the precision is limited. A float can have at most 7 decimals!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>double: It is used to store decimal numbers but with double precision, so it can have at most 15 decimals. It takes 8 bytes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In C, you could have the following code using  those data types:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    char a='p';
    int b = 12345;
    float c = 1.123456;
    double d = 1.012345678912345;
    printf("\n my char: %c ", a);
    printf("\n my int: %i ", b);
    printf("\n my float: %f ", c);
    printf("\n my double: %.16g \n\n", d);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create the  file 'print_data_types.c':</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">nano print_data_types.c</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt"> ./print_data_types</code></pre>

 my float: 1.123456
 my double: 1.012345678912345</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just saw how to print different data types. Things to note:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>%c is used to output a character. You can have it in any position of the first string you pass as argument to printf. You can also have it in several places if you pass more characters like this:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">printf("\n my char %c , my second char %c , my third char %c  ",a,a,a);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>%i is used to print an integer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>%f to print a float.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>%.16g is to print a float but we can specify the number of decimals we want, in this case 16, but we could change that number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important thing to note, that we already mention, is that a character is just a number that is interpreted as such. Do the following experiment: use %i instead of %c to print the character 'p' in our program. What number do you see and why that number?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answer: You should have seen 112. That happens because 112 is the ASCII of 'p', as we can see in the ASCII table:</p>

<h3 id="_c_pointers">8.4. C pointers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you need to store a list of integers, you could use  a buffer of memory to do it, which is just a chunk of empty memory that can be filled with the integers you need. For example, suppose we need to store a list of 5 integers and the print the whole list. We could do something like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
    int arr[5];
    arr[0]=11;
    arr[1]=12;
    arr[2]=13;
    arr[3]=14;
    arr[4]=15;
    for(int i=0;i&lt;5;i++)
    {
        printf("\n Array value at position %i: %i \n",i, arr[i]);
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the line 'int arr[5];' we are declaring an array of 5 integers. So the program allocated a buffer of 20 bytes, because each integer takes 4 bytes. Then we assign an arbitrary integer to each of the positions, and then we print them on a loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In C, the first line of a for loop is made up of three parts: In the first one, you can declare a variable and set its starting value. That is 'int i=0' in our code. The second part is the condition; the loop will keep iterating as long as that condition is met. In our code the condition is 'i&lt;5'. The third part is generally a modification you do so the loop advances. In this case we increment i by 1. Note that in C this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">i++;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is exactly the same as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">i=i+1;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside our loop, we print our counter 'i', and the current value at position in 'i' in the array. Put that code in a file using:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">nano print_array.c</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, everything seems to work fine. But now, add the following line after the for loop:</p>

<p>You might be thinking that line would cause an error, because we don&#8217;t even have a seventh position in our array. However, it will not! Compile again and run the code.

        printf("\n Array value at position %i: %i \n",i, arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n Array value at position 7: %i \n", arr[6]);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the output, should look, somewhat, like this:</p>

 Array value at position 7: 1695902208</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is going on here? we did not even had a 7th position. Our array is actually only 5 positions in size. This is something bad. What is happening, is that C does not actually have real arrays with size as other languages do. It is merely a chunk of memory. In this case, our variable 'arr' is just a pointer to the first byte of that chunk of memory. When we do, for example, arr[2], we are pointing to the first byte of the chunk of memory plus 8 bytes, because each integer has 4 bytes, so we move in memory to point to the place in which is stored the third position. You will understand this better as you advance in binary exploitation and understand how variables are placed in memory. For now, just know that C allocates the memory needed to place a buffer, but does not have any control that prevents you accessing the wrong place. In our example, 1695902208 is  value from our program that is 8 bytes away from the spots in which or array should be stored, it could be other variable. Many people claim that C does not have real arrays, because as you saw, it is just a chunk of memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In C, you can create not only variables, but also pointers to variables. A pointer simply stores the address in which a variable is located in memory. Now that you can read few lines of C, it is better to explain a program using the comments on C to explain the things that might be new to you. So, let&#8217;s take a look at the following program that illustrates pointers in an easy manner. Pay close attention to the comments. Create a file, paste that code, compile it, and run it as you already know how to. The following program might seem a bit long, but it is because it has several prints so you can understand what is happening. Is very easy to read. This is the program:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    //we declare a char:
    char c='S';
    //We declare a pointer to char, for that we use the *
    char *p;
    //Assign address of the char c, to pointer p. To get the address of a variable we use &amp;
    p=&amp;c;
    printf ("\n This is the value of char c: %c ", c);
    //As we said, we use &amp; to get the address. We are printing the memory address in which c is located:
    printf ("\n This is the address of char c: %d ", &amp;c);
    printf ("\n This is the address that pointer p is pointing at, which is the address of c: %d ", p);
    //we use * to get the content in the address we are pointing at
    printf ("\n This is the content of the address that pointer p is pointing at, which is the value of c: %c ", *p);
    printf ("\n This is the address of the pointer (a pointer has to be located somewhere as well as any variable): %d ", &amp;p);
    //
    //Now, we can use pointers to point to the first character of an array of characters, and move through it
    char *p2 ;
    //We use malloc to allocate 6 bytes
    p2 = malloc(6);
    printf ("\n This is the address that pointer p2 is pointing at %d ", p2);
    //Note: memory allocated with malloc, is allocated in the heap, so you see
    //that its value is far from the other values we have printed that were local
    //variables and are allocated in the stack. You will learn more about the stack and heap later.
    //p2 is pointing to memory in the heap, but it's a local variable, so if we print
    //its address it should be close to the other local variables:
    printf ("\n This is the address of  p2: %d ", &amp;p2);
    //Now we assign values to the bytes we have allocated:
    *(p2+0)='h';
    *(p2+1)='e';
    *(p2+2)='l';
    *(p2+3)='l';
    *(p2+4)='o';
    *(p2+5)=0;
    printf("\n This is p2 printed as a string: %s ",p2);
    //Note that 0 (the ASCII for NULL), is the end of the string.
    //Also note that 0 is different from '0', '0' is actually 48, if you print it as an int
    printf("\n This is the value of the zero char, different from null char: %d ",'0');
    //See what happens if we put a 0 in the middle of our char array:
    *(p2+2)=0;
    printf("\n This is the string we just created: %s ",p2);
    //It prints only "he"
    //
    //Of course a string can be created in a shorter way, for instance:
    char *p3=&amp;"hello";
    printf("\n This is the content pointed by p3: %s ", p3);
    //
    //Now, let's make a pointer to pointer to char, we will use the pointer p that points to the char c we declare previously
    char **pp;
    pp=&amp;p;
    //So, imagine pp is a box (the first box), that contains an address that points to a second box, that contains an address that points to a third box, that contains a char
    printf("\n This is the address in which pp is allocated, the address of the first box: %d ", &amp;pp);
    printf("\n This is the address  pp points at, the content of the first box: %d ", pp);
    printf("\n This is the content of the second box: %d ", *pp);
    printf("\n This is the content of the third box: %c ", **pp);
    //we can create as many pointers to pointers as we need:
    char ***ppp;
    ppp=&amp;pp;
    printf("\n This is the content of ***ppp: %c ", ***ppp);
    //
    //To explain why this could be useful, we will quote a StackOverflow post that is cool, from user pmg, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5580761/why-use-double-pointer-or-why-use-pointers-to-pointers
    //
    //"If you want to have a list of characters (a word), you can use char *word
    //If you want a list of words (a sentence), you can use char **sentence
    //If you want a list of sentences (a monologue), you can use char ***monologue
    //If you want a list of monologues (a biography), you can use char ****biography
    //If you want a list of biographies (a bio-library), you can use char *****biolibrary

    *(pp2+1)=&amp;"carnegie";
    *(pp2+2)=&amp;"mellon";
    printf("\n This is hi: %s ", *pp2);
    printf("\n This is carnegie: %s ", *(pp2+1));
    printf("\n This is mellon: %s ", *(pp2+2));
    //You might be wondering about the relation between arrays and pointers. Some people say in c, the use of [] is just syntactic sugar.
    //But there are not actual arrays on C.
    //In this expression it is created a pointer to the first element of the array. In fact, arr is pointer to the first element:
    char arr[5]="hello";
    //these expressions are the same:
    printf("\n This is arr[0]: %c ", arr[0]);

    printf("\n This is arr[3]: %c ", arr[4]);
    printf("\n This is *(arr+3): %c ", *(arr+4));
    //understanding that, you can see now why in C, a thing that looks very weird as the following, makes sense:
    printf("\n This is 1[arr]: %c ", 1[arr]);
    //As you see, it printed 'e', because that expression is just *(1+a), which is the same as *(a+1)
    //People says that proves that in C there are not actual arrays. What is our opinion? As long as you clearly
    //understand how it works in the languages you are using
    printf("\n SEE YOU!  keep on the good work! \n ");

<p>That was amazing. That is a beautiful hack! It is actually called a bithack! In a computer, this operation executes much faster than an "if" statement. In most of the programs you don´t need to execute an operation that fast to comply with the functionality you need, but in some cases that is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say that a hack could be simply a clever thing. Now, what is an exploit?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is an attack on a computer program. If a computer program has a vulnerability, a hacker can take advantage of such a vulnerability to make the program do something different from the original purpose of the program. Taking advantage of a vulnerability successfully, it is called an exploit.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You just hacked a very simple binary. But&#8230;&#8203; what happened on the inside? Why?  A very rough explenation, is that when you call a function, the computer needs to know how to come back to continue executing the code that called it after the function finishes its execution. The address of the piece of code that you should continue on after the function call (you do not see this in the source code), is called the return address. Since the program is not checking the boundaries of the input in the C program we made, you can overwrite the place in which the return address is stored! Let’s understand that better so you can manipulate similar exploits at your will.</p>

<p>The famous Stack Overflow is a type of Buffer Overflow, an anomaly that overwrites a memory sector where it should not. It causes security problems by opening doors for malicious actions to be executed. To understand it, it is necessary to have an idea of how the memory of a computer works.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_memory">9.3.1. Memory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RAM means "random access memory". It is called Random Access because you can access any part of it directly, without having to pass first for other regions, as it was necessary at some point in history. For example, computers used to have a magnetic tape in which an item of data could only be accessed by starting from the beginning of the tape and finding an address sequentially. In a RAM we can go to any part of it immediately!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conceptually, a RAM is a grid with slots that can contain data. Let&#8217;s imagine we have a RAM of only 5 slots. We could name each slot by a number, starting at 0, so it would look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/4image36.png" alt="image" width="198" height="222">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 51. Imagined memory</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if we want to put the word "HELLO" in our imaginary memory, we could put each character of "HELLO" in each slot, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/4image37.png" alt="image" width="198" height="222">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 52. Imagined memory containing 'HELLO'</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The numbers we used to identify each slot of the memory are called addresses. If we ask: what character is in the address 1? The answer would be the character ‘E’. A real memory from a computer nowadays can have billions of addresses. Normally, addresses are shown in hexadecimal. For example, the address "255" would normally be shown as "0xFF".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a program, the memory is used in a certain way to be able to do all that the program can do, and the program itself is present in memory when it is being executed. The memory is organized in the following sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we compile a C source code, this is converted to machine code also known as binary. When a program is run, this machine code is placed in the code section. The code section holds only machine code, not the source code we know from C for example. The machine code is a set of instructions that the processor of a computer can understand. The computer will execute the instructions sequentially and while doing that will access other parts of memory to read data and output results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A program has several sections, but for now, let&#8217;s keep in mind the following three sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data section</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stack</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the data section, static and global variables are placed. This variables always exist when the program is being run, in contrast to local variables that disappear when a function finishes and returns the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the heap is placed the memory allocated dynamically. For example, when you use malloc in C to allocate a buffer, that buffer is allocated on the heap. It is called dynamic allocation because the program allocates memory when is already running and executing the particular instruction for malloc. In the code you write you can also decide to deallocate a buffer of memory that you previously allocated. So, it is called dynamic because the programmer can allocate it and deallocate a chunk of memory of a desired size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Stack segment, are placed the local variables, function parameters and return addresses. What is a return address? When we call a function, the address of the next instruction has to be stored somewhere so the program knows where to comeback after the function is finished. We call this address the "return address". A function can be called in different parts of a program, so this return address will be different depending on where the program calls the function.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_example_of_execution_of_a_program">9.4. Example of Execution of a program</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution of a program and its memory is controlled by processor registers, usually called simply registers. These are a very small and fast kind of memory that is attached to the processor. A register can store 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the processor. A processor only has a few registers. Depending on the kind of processor, the registers might differ. But we will take a look at the ones that are generic to most processors and will let us understand later the most common binary exploits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see a real example in action we can use GDB, a software that allows us to see the execution of each part of a programs and its memory step by step. This kind of software is called a debugger. When a binary program is running and we debug it, we can see in detail what the program is doing in memory by analyzing the <strong>Assembly</strong>. What is the Assembly? It is a low level language that can be used to show what each instruction from the machine code does. GDB can generate assembly from the machine code in memory while we are debugging the program so we can easily see what the machine code is doing.</p>

<p>A program is made up of several instructions that are executed sequentially. The processor of the computer has an integrated and very small memory different from RAM, called the "registers". A processor only has a few registers. Each register can hold only 8 bytes in a 64 bit processor, and 4 bytes in a 32 bit processor. A 32 bit program can run on a 64 bit processor, but 64 bit program cannot run on a 32 bit processor. One of the registers is called the Instruction Pointer, abbreviated as IP, that keeps track of the part of the program that is currently being executed. In a 64 bit program, we can print the value of this register in GDB using "x $rip":</p>

To be more precise, a breakpoint on a function is usually placed 4 bytes after the beginning of the machine code of what is considered the function. That’s why the "+4". Later we will understand why it’s done like this. The remaining part, "0x80c48348", is the actual content at the address "0x4005ce".

<p>Each line of what was just printed by GDB is organized in three parts. Let’s analyze the following line to introduced machine code and assembly:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>0x400602 &lt;+56&gt;: 48 89 c7 mov %rax,%rdi</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The left part is the address "0x400602 &lt;+56&gt;". After the address some spaces are shown, then in the middle we find the machine code, that in this case is "48 89 c7". After some other spaces, we find the Assembly, which is "mov %rax,%rdi". Assembly is a low level language that can be directly mapped to the machine code. That’s why GDB can see some machine code in the memory and print for us the assembly that represents. A specific sequence of bytes in the machine code maps to an instruction of assembly. So, when a program is running and in memory is seen the sequence of bytes "48 89 c7" in the code segment, the computer knows that is some specific instruction and the processor has to do a specific action. Right now the intention is not to explain assembly in detail, but just for the sake of this example, know that "mov %rax,%rdi" moves the value of the register "rax" into the register "rdi". While the program is being executed by going forward in the code section of memory where the machine code is located, and it appears the sequence of bytes "48 89 c7", the processor knows that it has to copy the register "rax" into "rdi". Note that in the function, there are two parts in which appears the machine code "48 89 c7" and both have the same assembly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, in this line:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>&#8658;</strong> 0x4005ce &lt;+4&gt;: 48 83 c4 80 add $0xffffffffffffff80,%rsp</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>do you see the arrow "&#8658;" at the left? That indicates the instruction in which we are. Next to it there is an address, that as expected, has the same value as the Instruction Pointer. Then there is the &lt;+4&gt; which we already explained, followed by the machine code "48 83 c4 80" at the address 0x4005ce… Hold on, what is going on? A few paragraphs ago we said that the machine code at that address was " 0x 80 c4 83 48" when we printed the Instruction Pointer using "x $rip". But now we say it is "48 83 c4 80". If you look closely, these are the same bytes but backwards. Let’s take advantage of this opportunity to explain "little endian".</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_19_2_1_3_little_endian">19.2.1.3 Little endian</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most of the computers we use in everyday life, the numbers are interpreted as little endian. So when you read this from memory:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>48 83 c4 80</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will be interpreted and shown as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>80 c4 83 48</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the case only for numbers. Addresses are numbers. In an attack when you want to overwrite an address, you have to consider this and input the bytes of the address backwards so they are interpreted in the correct manner. Why computers do this? There are some reasons and consequences. In fact there are also reasons for using "big endian" which is using the bytes without inverting them. One argument commonly given for supporting little endian, is that some operations are easier to do. For instance, if you have a number, let’s say 255 in decimal, in hexadecimal it would be is 0xff in hexadecimal. If the number is contained in a variable type that takes 4 bytes, for example an "int" in C, it would look like this in memory:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ff 00 00 00</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, you want to cast it to a type that only takes two bytes, for example a "short" in C. In memory, you can leave the same value without having to move anything, and the "short" would look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ff 00</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, imagine that we were not using little endian. The type "int" would hold the number like this</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>00 00 00 ff</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the "short" like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>00 ff</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we had to move the ff, which originally was on the fourth byte, and now it is in the second byte.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, what you should remember for binary exploits, is that if you want to write a number into memory, you have to write its bytes backwards. Also, remember that this is only for numbers. In a hypothetical situation if you want to place in memory the string "HELLO", you can put it in its original order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In GDB is possible to show a chunk of memory at a specific location using a command such as "x/16xw 0x4005da". This will print 16 words after the address 0x4005da. A word in a 64 bit processor, has 8 bytes, so that command is going to print 64 bytes. Run the command yourself! You should see something like this:</p>

<h5 id="_function_call">Function call</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a function is called, the IP moves to wherever the code of the function is located. When the function is finished, the IP moves back to the next instruction to the function call. As we mentioned previously, the address of the next instruction has to be stored somewhere so the program knows where to comeback after the function is finished. We call this address the "return address". The return address is stored in the memory segment refered as the stack. How do we know in which part of the stack? There is a register called the Stack Pointer (SP), that points to the tip of the stack. When a function is called, the stack pointer moves to make room for the return address and new local variables. When the function is finished, the Stack Pointer moves to the original position prior to the function call, making the memory addresses in which the local variables from the function were located free again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that we have a toy memory with only a few addresses. Remember that the SP is the Stack Pointer, and the Stack is a region of memory, in this case colored in yellow. Suppose that we have created no local variables or anything on the stack. The stack would look like this:</p>

<p>Then we create a local variable, using something like:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="c">int var=4;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that is executed, the stack would look like in the following image, because by creating a variable we push it into the stack (in this example we are using “&#8656;” as a simple arrow):</p>

<p>Note that when we push a variable into the stack, we subtract one address to the SP, so it points to the new top of the stack. In this case the new SP value will be 16, which means is pointing to the address 16. If we create another local variable like this:</p>

<h2 id="_assembly">10. Assembly</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We previously saw in binary exploitation how some registers work and how the memory of a program is allocated. Once you get some idea of how to do basic binary exploits, to enter in a more advance level it is useful to understand the assembly in more detail. There a several assembly languages and they are exclusive to the processor architecture of a computer. Processor architectures have specific instructions. For example,  an Intel processor can execute different instruction than an ARM processor, hence, the assembly language for ARM is different than the one for Intel. To begin, we will be using Intel assembly just for the fact that Intel architecture is widely used. The shell server, and your computer probably, have an Intel architecture. Note that the AMD processors have the same architecture and instruction set as Intel. Smartphones, in contrast to most laptops or desktops computers, generally have an ARM processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intel is CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer); that implies that it has much more instructions than ARM which is RISC (Reduced Set Instruction Computer). However, we will only be exploring some instruction in intel that are common and useful to know. It would be too dense to begin to explain instructions independently. Instead, let’s make a program and begin to understand it. Assembly is not easy to abstract at the beginning, but once you learn a few things, it becomes very intuitive and it is possible to read assembly to understand the logic of a program in an architecture you never saw before because it has similar patterns. Therefore, we encourage you to keep trying on this part even if it seems not easy to grasp at the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_registers">10.1. Registers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will show in this part, for reference, the most relevant registers from Intel Architecture for an example of a program in assembly we will introduce. The Intel registers are broken down in several categories. They include General Registers, Segment Registers, Index/Pointer Registers, and Flags registers.  For now, it is good to see the purpose of each of the registers in two of those categories.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_general_registers">10.2. General Registers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in the General Registers, when we are using processor of 64 bits, the register name begins with R. In a 32 bits processor, the register name begins with E, and in 16-bit architecture, it does not have a prefix and the name is only two letters. For example, there is a 16-bit register called AX. In 32 bits, we have the same register for the same purpose, but it can hold 32 bits, and it is called EAX. In 64 bits, that same register is called RAX. We can use a 16-bit or 32-bit register in a 64-bit architecture, but not the other way around. Each register is conventionally used for some specific operations, but they can be used for other purposes. These are the General Registers in 16, 32, 64 bits:
RAX,EAX,AX (Accumulator register):  It is usually used to place the return value of a function but can be used for other purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REX,EBX,BX (Base register): Used as the base pointer for memory access. We subtract or add an offset to the value of this register to access variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RCX,ECX,CX (Counter register): Called the. Usually used as a loop counter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RDX,EDX,DX (Data register): Usually used to store temporary data in operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in  a 64 bits program, the conventions can change. For example, in a 32-bit architecture we generally pass the arguments of a function in the stack, while in 64-bit programs we pass them in registers in many cases. For now, do not worry about those details. Focus on getting a sense on how assembly works when we show the example of a program in assembly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_index_pointer_registers">10.3. Index/Pointer Registers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These registers are used to mark the end or start of a region of memory to allow a program keeping track of elements such as location of variables or the top of the stack, which are essential to manipulate data in memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSP,ESP,SP (Stack pointer register): Indicates the top of the stack. Whenever we create a local variable, this pointer changes to allow space to that variable. For example, if we create an variable that takes 4 bytes, the stack pointer moves 4 bytes to make room for that new variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RIP,EIP,IP (Instruction Pointer): Indicates the current instruction that the program is executing. If we make this register pointing to an address, the program will execute the code at that address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RBP,EBP,BP (Base pointer register): Indicates the beginning of the stack frame of a function. The stack frame is a region of memory in which we place data, such as local variables, from a specific function. To access a local variable from a function, we take the address of the base pointer and subtract an offset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RDI,EDI,DI (Destination index register): Generally used for copying chunks of memory, that can be strings or arrays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSI,ESI,SI (Source index register): Similar purpose to the previous register (Destination index register).</p>

<p>In AT&amp;T syntax,  there are several differences. One of them that is notorious, is that you see the symbol % all around, which is used to prefix registers.  Also, in some operations the position of arguments is different. Keep in mind this to prevent confusion. We will explain the program using Intel syntax, following each line of the assembly code. Remember from the binary exploitation section,  that the hexadecimal number we observe at the left, for example this ‘0x000055555555471a &lt;+0&gt;:’, is the memory address in which that instruction of assembly is  located on RAM.  In the first line of assembly we see in the main function is the following (we removed the address shown at the left for simplicity):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">push   rbp</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We observe the instruction ‘push rbp’. As we know already, rbp is the base pointer, which is a register used to keep track of the part of the stack in which the local variables of a function begin to be stored. In this case, the current value of the rbp is pushed into the stack, to be able to recover it later. This is an important part of a function that allow us to keep the value of the base pointer from the previous function. For example, suppose you have a function call inside another function, like in the following example in which we call func2 from func1:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">Void func2(){
	char var4;
char var5;
char var6;
}
Void func1(){
	char var1;
char var2;
char var3;
	func2();
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The piece of memory in which are stored the variables of a function is called the stack frame. In assembly we do not have variable names, instead,  we have the rbp pointing to  the memory address in which begins the stack frame of a function. For example, if the program is currently executing func2, the three variables declared in func2, could look like the following in memory:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 57. Stack frame of func2</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we want to access the value of var6, we do rbp minus 3. Note that if we subtract three positions from rbp, we would be pointing to var6. As you can see, accessing variables in assembly is not complicated, we just need to subtract from rbp some positions to point to the variable we want. However, we just have one register in the processor to keep the value of the base pointer. So, what we do, is pushing into memory the value of the base pointer from the previous function. That is the “rbp func1” that you see in the memory from the previous image. We store the rbp from a previous function, as we store a local variable, to be able to recover it later when we come back to func1 and be able to access the variable from func1. We explained all that to point out what was this line for:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="txt">push   rbp</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that line of assembly, we are storing the previous value of the rbp, to later restore it when we return from the current function. The instruction push, places  the value of a registry into memory, and subtracts the size of the register to the stack pointer. In an Intel processor of 64 bits, a register is 8 bytes. So, when we do ‘push rbp’, it is automatically subtracted 8 to the stack pointer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second line:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We assign the stack pointer value to the base pointer. Mov, in Intel syntax, assigns the value of the  operand at the right side to the operand at the left side. In this case, rsp (stack pointer), is the operand at the right side, and rbp (base pointer) is the operand at the left.
Such an assignment is done, because at the beginning of a function the stack pointer is pointing to the beginning of the stack frame. When push variables in a function, the stack pointer will move, because the stack pointer will be pointing always to the last variable pushed. Then, in the line:</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are subtracting 16 bytes  from the stack pointer. Note that the prefix ‘0x’ is used to denote a hexadecimal number. 10 in hexadecimal is 16 in decimal.  In Intel syntax,  the instructions ‘sub’ subtracts the operand at the right side to the operand on the left side. In this case, we subtract 10 from rsp. That subtraction is done to allocate 16 bytes on the stack. We will assign values in those bytes later. So far, we have something like the following, in which we have 16 bytes allocated:</p>

<p>‘je’ means jump if equals. If the result of the XOR is zero, which would set the flags as if a comparison was equal,  we jump to 0x55555555479f. What we are doing at a general level in the last lines, is taking the stack canary from our stack frame. Remember that the stack canary was previously  stored there. Now we compare it with the original value of the stack canary at fs:0x28. If the value is the same, it means that the chunk of memory which was holding the stack canary in the stack frame was never overwritten. If it was never overwritten, we do a jump to skip this line:</p>

<p>The instruction ‘leave’ restores the old value of the EBP that was stored in the stack. As we explained, the ebp from the previous function that called the current function is stored in the stack. Then, ‘ret’ pops the return address from the stack and redirects the execution of the program to that address. Note that a program can redirect its execution to other address by assigning that address to the rip (instruction pointer). The instruction ‘ret’ automatically pops an address from the stack and assigns it to the instruction pointer.</p>
